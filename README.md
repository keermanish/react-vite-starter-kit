# React Starter Kit

Intention is to have some light-weight starter kit for any react (static) applications. Faster :rocket: build time, type-safe, linting, etc, are the things which have been considered for this setup.

## Includes

- React 18 (latest)
- TypeScript
- Vite
- wouter
- Prettier
- ESLint and StyleLint
- husky with lint-staged

## How to start

- Fork and clone this repo
- `nvm use` (make sure you have latest node 17 OR `nvm` installed)
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
